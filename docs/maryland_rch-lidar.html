### Local processing

The local PC has CloudCompare and QGIS installed, these are not available on Google Colab so it's necessary to moved files from Google Drive and process them on a PC and then move them back. Manual tasks but I could not find a better means to process these files using this collection of software.
On the local PC laz files will be converted to DEM using CloudCompare. CloudCompare is not installed on Google Colab so it's used on the local PC.

4 batches of 50 laz files (ex: 0-49, 50-99, 100-149, 150-199) will be downloaed into a folder that can contain 200 files (ex: laz_utm_0-199).

Create folders to hold downladed files. Example: E:\a_new_orgs\carleton\hist5706-maryland\lidar_files\reprojected\laz_utm_0-199. This can be done by running the first cell of 1_1_Maryland_download_laz_tiles_use_CloudCompare_to_convert_to_DEM

Download the files from Google Drive, unzip into directory. Example: /content/drive/MyDrive/crane_maryland/laz/laz_fema_2012_forested_utm/batch_50/laz_utm_0-49
